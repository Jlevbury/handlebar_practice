- `node_modules`: Contains all the Node.js modules installed for your project.
- `public`: Used to serve static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- `views`: This is where you keep your Handlebars templates. Each file in this directory corresponds to a different page on your website.
- `views/partials`: Contains partial templates, which are reusable pieces of HTML.
- `views/layouts`: Contains layout templates, which define the common structure of your pages.
- `.env`: (Optional) Contains environment variables for your app.
- `package.json`: Contains metadata about your app and lists its dependencies.
- `app.js`: The main entry point to your app. This is where you set up your Express server and define your routes.

Here's a step-by-step recap of what we've done so far:

1. **Set Up the Project**: We created a new Node.js project and installed the necessary dependencies.

2. **Set Up Express and Handlebars**: In `app.js`, we created an Express app and set up Handlebars as our view engine.

3. **Defined Routes**: We added routes to our Express app using `app.get()` and `app.post()`. These routes render views and handle form submissions.

4. **Created Views**: We created Handlebars views for each of our routes. These views include a home page, an about page, and a page to display a submitted name.

5. **Created and Used Partials**: We created a partial for our navbar and used it in our views. This allows us to reuse the same navbar across multiple pages.

6. **Created a Layout**: We created a layout that includes the common structure of our pages. This layout is used as the default for all of our views.

7. **Handled Form Submissions**: We created a form on our home page, and a route to handle the form's POST request. The route extracts the submitted name and passes it to a view, which displays the name.

8. **Ran the App**: Finally, we ran our app using `node app.js` and tested it in the browser and with Insomnia.


Absolutely, here's a brief overview of Handlebars syntax, including block helpers, conditional statements, and logic.

1. **Basic Syntax**

    The basic syntax of Handlebars involves wrapping variables in double curly braces like `{{variable}}`. Handlebars will replace these placeholders with the actual values when the template is rendered. 

    Example:
    ```handlebars
    <h1>Welcome, {{name}}!</h1>
    ```

2. **Block Helpers**

    Block helpers are used for complex logic in Handlebars templates. They are defined in JavaScript and used in the template inside `{{#helper}}...{{/helper}}`.

    - `{{#each}}...{{/each}}`: This block helper iterates over an array or object. Inside the `each` block, you can use `this` to reference the current item.

        Example:
        ```handlebars
        <ul>
        {{#each names}}
            <li>{{this}}</li>
        {{/each}}
        </ul>
        ```

    - `{{#if}}...{{/if}}`: This block helper is used for conditional rendering. It checks if a condition is truthy. If it is, it renders the block of code inside the `if`. You can also add an `{{else}}` block which is rendered when the condition is falsey.

        Example:
        ```handlebars
        {{#if user}}
            <h1>Welcome back, {{user}}!</h1>
        {{else}}
            <h1>Welcome, guest!</h1>
        {{/if}}
        ```

3. **Escape and Unescaped Expressions**

    By default, Handlebars escapes values when using the `{{variable}}` syntax. This means it will convert characters like `<`, `>`, `&` into safe text. If you don't want Handlebars to escape a value, you can use triple braces like `{{{variable}}}`.

    Example:
    ```handlebars
    <div>{{{htmlContent}}}</div>
    ```

4. **Comments**

    You can add comments to your Handlebars templates using the `{{!-- --}}` syntax. Handlebars will ignore anything inside these tags.

    Example:
    ```handlebars
    {{!-- This is a Handlebars comment. --}}
    ```

5. **Partials**

    Partials allow you to reuse pieces of HTML across multiple templates. They are defined using the `{{>partialName}}` syntax.

    Example:
    ```handlebars
    {{> navbar}}
    ```

Remember, Handlebars is logic-less, meaning it's designed to keep logic out of your templates as much as possible. It's best used for simple logic like loops and conditionals. For more complex logic, it's usually best to prepare the data in JavaScript before passing it to the template.
